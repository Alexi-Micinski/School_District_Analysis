# School District Analysis

## Overview

School board and superindentants require standardized test analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance, trends, and patterns, which be used to make informed decisions at the school and district level. Student funding and standarized test scores will be analyzed using math and reading score data. The data will be aggregated to show trends in school performance.

After the initial analysis, evidence showed academic dishonesty among the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board wants to uphold state-testing standards and has asked that the ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School be replaced. The analysis will then be repeated and changes in the overall analysis will be described.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
